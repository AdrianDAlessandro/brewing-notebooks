        # ### Calculate Water amounts
        # Need functions to take in batch size and work out the amounts all the way to strike water, inculding assumptions for losses etc.
        # Calculations and definitions from [Mash Hacks](https://mashhacks.com/how-to-calculate-water-volumes-for-brewing/):
        # 
        # - **Strike Water** - The starting amount of hot water (usually between 60C and 80C) that is used for the mash (adding grain to water).
        # - **Grain Absorption** - The amount of water absorbed by the grain.
        # - **First Runnings** - The amount of wort (sugary water) that is collected from the mash tun after your mash has finished.
        # - **Sparge Water** - Water that is added to the mash tun after mashing to rinse the grain of any left over sugars.
        # - **Pre-Boil Volume** - The amount of wort (sugary water) that is in your kettle before you start your boil.
        # - **Evaporation Rate** - The amount of water that is boiled off. Usually in Litres per Hour (or Gal/hr).
        # - **Post-Boil Volume** - The amount of wort left after you finish the boil.
        # - **Kettle Loss** - The amount of wort (if any) left at the bottom of the kettle that was not transferred to the fermenter.
        # - **Fermenter Volume** - The amount of wort you were able to get out of the kettle and put into the fermenter.
        # - **Trub Loss** aka *Fermenter loss* - The amount of beer (if any) at the bottom of the fermenter that was not transferred into bottles or kegs.
        # - **Batch Size** - The amount of beer that you were able to get out of the fermenter and put into bottles or kegs.

        # Define some constants
        constants = {
            "Evaporation Rate" : 3, # Approximate rate of evaporation at boil (L/hr)
            "Grain Absorption Rate" : 1, # Approximate loss of volume due to grain absorption (L/kg)
            "Efficiency" : 0.8 # Efficiency of getting sugars from malt
        }
        
        # Calculte Water Volumes
        fermenter_vol = batch_size + trub_loss
        post_boil_vol = fermenter_vol + kettle_loss
        pre_boil_vol = post_boil_vol + constants["Evaporation Rate"] * boil_time

        strike_water = 3 * grain_mass
        grain_absorption = constants["Grain Absorption Rate"] * grain_mass
        first_runnings = strike_water - grain_absorption

        sparge_water = pre_boil_vol - first_runnings


        # ### Calculate Expected Original Gravity

        # Mash Efficiency - from https://aussiehomebrewer.com/threads/working-out-mash-efficiency-in-metric.35490/
        # 
        # How it works is all malts and adjuncts etc give a different gravity. 
        # The specs are all written as H.W.E which is hot water extract with sugar being the highest at 386 so everything else is given as a % of that. ie, pale malt is around 81% which gives you around 309. this is the total gravity you can get with 1 kilo in 1 litre but it is impossible to get this, this is 100% effeincy.
        # the same goes for american calcs but its in P.P.G which is the gravity of 1 pound in 1 gallon. The same specs are used ie. 81% for pale malt gives you 37 points of gravity.
        # 
        # So a simple example to work out total potential for 5 kg of pale malt in 23 litres is
        # 5 x 309 / 23 = 67 (1.067)
        # 
        # now to work out your effiency you divide the gravity you got with this brew. Say you got 1.050 so 50/67 =.74 you got 74% effiency.
        # Then next time when you do the calc. 5 x 309 /23 =you simply times this by .74 .
        # This gives you your expected gravity, 
        # 
        # For your first batches i would stick to using 60-65%.
        # So do the 5 x 309/ 23 = 67.
        # then times 67 by .65 = 43(1.043)
        # 
        # p.s the hwe numbers are all on the malt craft site other malts like crystal malt are around 75% some malts can be lower and some higher.
        # to get the number times 386 by the percent as a decimal point ie pale malt at 81% gives you 386 x .81 =312 
        # 
        # Ale -------81% X 386 = 312
        # Pilsner----------------81%
        # Hoepfner Munich----80% 308
        # Melanoiden--------- -80%
        # Caramalt pils---------79% 305
        # Crystal---------------- 75%
        # 
        # Well, it's the method you will see in Australia. 
        # 
        # Say the HWE is 308 litre degrees per kilogram for a malt. 
        # That means 5kg in 20L will give you : (308 x 5)/20 = 77. i.e. 1.077 SG at 100% efficiency. Multiply that by your efficiency (eg. 75%) gives you 77 x 0.75 = 57.75 or close enough to 1.058.


        # Swapped strike and sparge waters
        malt = {
            '2-Row' : 1.015,
            'Crystal' : 250
        }
        hops = {
            '60m' : 6,
            '30m' : 6,
            '5m' : 6,

        # ### Calculate IBU
        # http://www.backtoschoolbrewing.com/blog/2016/9/5/how-to-calculate-ibus
        # http://www.realbeer.com/hops/research.html
        # 
        # To calculate IBUs, the formula is simple:
        # `IBUs = decimal alpha acid utilization * mg/l of added alpha acids`
        # `mg/l of added alpha acids = decimal AA rating * grams hops * 1000 / volume of finished beer in liters`
        # `decimal alpha acid utilization = Bigness factor * Boil Time factor`
        # `Bigness factor = 1.65 * 0.000125^(wort gravity - 1)`
        # `Boil Time factor = (1 - e^(-0.04 * time in mins) ) / 4.15`

        def ibu(mass_hops, batch_size, aa_rating, boil_gravity=original_gravity, boil_time=60):
            boil_time_factor = (1 - math.exp(-0.04 * boil_time)) / 4.15

            bigness_factor = 1.65 * 0.000125**(boil_gravity - 1)

            aa_utilization = bigness_factor * boil_time_factor

            aa_concentration = aa_rating / 100 * mass_hops * 1000 / batch_size

            return aa_utilization * aa_concentration

        ibu(6, 4, 5.5, boil_time=60) + ibu(6, 4, 5.5, boil_time=30) + ibu(6, 4, 5.5, boil_time=5)


        # ### Calculate EBC
        # http://beersmith.com/blog/2008/04/29/beer-color-understanding-srm-lovibond-and-ebc/
        # http://homebrewtechniques.com/mashing/how-do-you-calculate-beer-colour/
        # 
        # The calculation we use to work out the colour value for our beer is:
        # MCU = weight of malt (in lbs) x malt colour (in lovibond) / volume (in gallons)
        # (lovibond = SRM)
        # To convert our recipe from kg and litres into US gallons and lbs we use the following conversion factors:
        # 1 litre = 0.264172 US gallons
        # 1 kg = 2.20462 lbs.
        # SRM = 1.4922 * MCU^0.6859
        # EBC = 1.97 * SRM 

        def ebc(grain_mass, malt_colour, batch_size):
            return 1.97 * (1.4922 * ((grain_mass*2.2*malt_colour/1.97)/(batch_size*0.264172))**0.6859)

        ebc(0.51, 3.5, 4) + ebc(0.505, 6, 4) + ebc(0.250, 50, 4)
