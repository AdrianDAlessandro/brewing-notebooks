        # Calculations and definitions from [Mash Hacks](https://mashhacks.com/how-to-calculate-water-volumes-for-brewing/):
        # 
        # - **Strike Water** - The starting amount of hot water (usually between 60C and 80C) that is used for the mash (adding grain to water).
        # - **Grain Absorption** - The amount of water absorbed by the grain.
        # - **First Runnings** - The amount of wort (sugary water) that is collected from the mash tun after your mash has finished.
        # - **Sparge Water** - Water that is added to the mash tun after mashing to rinse the grain of any left over sugars.
        # - **Pre-Boil Volume** - The amount of wort (sugary water) that is in your kettle before you start your boil.
        # - **Evaporation Rate** - The amount of water that is boiled off. Usually in Litres per Hour (or Gal/hr).
        # - **Post-Boil Volume** - The amount of wort left after you finish the boil.
        # - **Kettle Loss** - The amount of wort (if any) left at the bottom of the kettle that was not transferred to the fermenter.
        # - **Fermenter Volume** - The amount of wort you were able to get out of the kettle and put into the fermenter.
        # - **Trub Loss** aka *Fermenter loss* - The amount of beer (if any) at the bottom of the fermenter that was not transferred into bottles or kegs.
        # - **Batch Size** - The amount of beer that you were able to get out of the fermenter and put into bottles or kegs.
